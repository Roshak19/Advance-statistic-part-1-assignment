        "\n",
        "1. **Right-Skewed**:\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Non-negative**:\n",
        "   - F-values are always **non-negative** (â‰¥ 0) because they represent a ratio of variances, which cannot be negative.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Depends on Degrees of Freedom**:\n",
        "   - The shape of the F-distribution is determined by **two degrees of freedom**: one for the **numerator** (between-group variance) and one for the **denominator** (within-group variance).\n",
        "   - As the degrees of freedom increase, the distribution becomes less skewed and approaches a normal distribution.\n",

        "**ANOVA** (Analysis of Variance) is a statistical technique used to compare the means of **three or more groups** to determine if there is a significant difference among them. It tests the null hypothesis that all group means are equal. ANOVA works by analyzing the variance within each group and between the groups.\n",

        "### How ANOVA Differs from a **t-test**:\n",
        "1. **Number of Groups**:\n",
        "   - **T-test**: Compares the means of **two groups** to see if they are significantly different from each other.\n",
        "   - **ANOVA**: Compares the means of **three or more groups** to check if at least one group mean differs significantly from the others.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Hypothesis Testing**:\n",
        "   - **T-test**: Tests whether the difference between two group means is statistically significant.\n",
        "   - **ANOVA**: Tests whether there are any significant differences **among the means of multiple groups**. If ANOVA indicates a significant difference, follow-up tests (like Tukey's HSD) are used to identify which specific groups are different.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Type of Test**:\n",
        "   - **T-test**: Relies on comparing the difference in means and the standard error of the difference for two groups.\n",
        "   - **ANOVA**: Uses variance analysis by comparing the variability between groups (between-group variance) to the variability within groups (within-group variance).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Difference:\n",

        "\n",
        "Use a **One-Way ANOVA** when you are comparing the means of **three or more groups** and want to test if at least one of the group means is significantly different from the others.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why One-Way ANOVA is Preferred Over Multiple t-tests:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Control of Type I Error**:\n",
        "   - When you conduct multiple **t-tests**, each test carries a chance of making a **Type I error** (incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis). The more t-tests you run, the higher the cumulative probability of a false positive.\n",
        "   - **One-Way ANOVA** controls the **overall Type I error rate** by testing all group means simultaneously. It evaluates the variance between all groups in one test, reducing the chance of making an error by chance.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Efficiency**:\n",
        "   - **ANOVA** tests all group comparisons in one analysis, while **multiple t-tests** require separate comparisons between pairs of groups. This makes **ANOVA** more efficient, particularly with large numbers of groups.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Comprehensive Testing**:\n",
        "   - **One-Way ANOVA** tests if there are any significant differences **among all groups**. Multiple t-tests only test specific pairs of groups and cannot tell you if there is an overall difference across all groups.\n",
        "   - **ANOVA** provides a single test statistic (F-statistic) to assess the overall difference, and if significant, follow-up tests (e.g., Tukey's HSD) can identify which specific groups differ.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary:\n",
        "**One-Way ANOVA** is preferred when comparing three or more groups because it reduces the risk of Type I error, is more efficient, and provides a comprehensive analysis of group differences in one step, while multiple t-tests are more error-prone and less efficient for multiple comparisons.\n",
